Hi,

My personal data, including my email address, are protected under data protection law. The General Data protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the processing of my email address and any other information related to me.

The provisions of the GDPR apply to your establishment under Article 3, which states that the regulation applies if the activities of your establishment or those of one of its subcontractors take place within the territory of the European Union. Additionally, it applies if your processing of personal data concerns individuals within the European Union in the context of offering goods or services, even if your company is based outside the European Union.

As a result, as a data controller, you are subject to certain obligations.
In particular, Articles 13 to 15 of the GDPR require you to provide me with certain information during the collection of my personal data and upon my request when exercising my right of access. In this regard, I kindly request that you provide all the information listed in Article 15 of the GDPR, including all data concerning me, the purpose of your processing, the source of my data, and the recipients of this data, particularly those located in countries outside the European Union, if applicable.

I also request that you provide the legal basis for your data processing, which must be one of those mentioned in Article 6(1) of the GDPR, unless you can demonstrate that you have already provided this information under Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR. If the legal basis for processing my personal data is my consent (Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR), please provide evidence of my explicit and freely given consent as outlined in Article 7 of the GDPR. If the basis is your legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR), please specify this interest as required by the provisions of these articles.

I remind you of your obligation to respond to my request as soon as possible and in any case within a period of one month from the receipt of this request, pursuant to Article 12(3) of the GDPR. After this period, I will file a complaint with the competent authority and reserve the possibility of any other legal action.

In accordance with Article 17 of the GDPR, I also ask you, **only after fulfilling your obligation to communicate to me the information I request above under my right of access**, to proceed without delay to the destruction of all personal data concerning me that you hold, and this in all of your databases (including backups).

Pending your response to my access request under Article 15 to enable me to exercise my right to erasure under Article 17, I ask you to immediately implement my right to restriction of processing as provided for in Article 18 of the GDPR and immediately suspend any use, for any purpose, of all personal data concerning me.

Finally, I would appreciate it if you would proceed with this deletion with ANY OTHER service provider to whom my personal data may have been communicated and provide me with the documents attesting to these deletions, as provided for in Article 19 of the GDPR.
